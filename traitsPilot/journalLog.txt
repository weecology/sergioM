so far I am trying to define how to build a bunch of PFT on a continental scale (US). My idea is to take traits data (Try database?), bind them to environmental/remotely estimable values, and categorize each trait by using Random Forest technique. The random forest will give me an “importance" order (and relative weight) of the spatial available data. That algorithm will then be used to spatially interpolate the potential distribution of the particular examined trait. Hence, at the end of that analysis I will have a bunch of traits-specific rasters for each “important” trait, which I would finally combine to create a potential set of fake species. 
One problem in the final phase would probably be how to further clusterize the potential “infinite” combination of traits observed in the continent (I guess another random forest?).
At that point we may have a set of n species different enough to be competing in the process based model (PBM). 
I am already doing this work as a pilot on Oregon/North California, using NACP TERRA-PNW data (https://daac.ornl.gov/NACP/guides/NACP_TERRA-PNW.html).
